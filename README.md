## About PyFBA

PyFBA is a Python flux-balance-analysis package that allows you to build models from genomes, gapfill models, and run
flux-balance-analysis on that model. The aim of PyFBA is to provide an extensible, python-based platform for
FBA work.

PyFBA is being developed by Daniel Cuevas, Taylor O'Connell, Shane Levi, and Rob Edwards in [Rob's bioinformatics
group](http://edwards.sdsu.edu/research) at [San Diego State University](http://www.sdsu.edu/) together with help from
Janaka Edirisinghe, Chris Henry, Ross Overbeek and others at [Argonne National Labs](http://www.theseed.org/).

You can [read more about PyFBA](http://linsalrob.github.io/PyFBA/) on our github.io pages.

## Installing PyFBA

To use PyFBA you need Python 3.0 or greater, and you need to [install the GNU GLPK](INSTALLATION.md) and a Python
wrapper for that program, pyGLPK available from [github](https://github.com/bradfordboyle/pyglpk). 

We also leverage the [Model SEED GitHub](https://github.com/ModelSEED/ModelSEEDDatabase.git) repository with all the
latest biochemistry tables. 

Our [installation](INSTALLATION.md) page has detailed instructions on installing PyFBA and getting everything running.

## Getting Started with PyFBA

Once you have installed GLPK, PyGLPK, and PyFBA, you will most likely want to build a model from a genome, gap fill that
model, and test it for growth on different media. We have [detailed instructions](GETTING_STARTED.md) that walk you through the step-by-step
procedures that you need to use to run flux balance analysis on your own genome.

## Updating to Python 3

This branch of PyFBA is compatible with Python 3, however that currently breaks compatibility with Python 2 because we use
an open syntax that is not supported in earlier Python versions.

To update to Python 3 from a working Python 2 installation, you will need to reinstall pyGLPK available from
[github](https://github.com/bradfordboyle/pyglpk). Checkout that code, `cd` into the directory, and then install it 
using `python3 setup.py`. Everything else should work just fine.

If you `cd` into the PyBFA directory, `nosetests3 tests/` should successfully run 77 tests with no errors.
