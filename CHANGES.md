# Version 1.3

### Updated parse/model_seed.py to work with reformatted ModelSEED database.

This restores base functionality, but also breaks compatibility with
many of the accessory and testing scripts. These will be the focus of
update 2.0 to be released early 2020.

### Updated parse/SBML.py to include different biomass equation identifiers.

### Added function to obtain InChI keys for compounds in your sbml

* example_code/extract_inchi.py

### Added function to convert .gff output from rast into assigned_functions.

* example_code/extract_functions.py

### Added example code compatible with the new database and python3.

* example_code/run_fba_sbml3.py

### Updated example_code/sbml_to_fba.py for compatibility.
Some tested SBML files used different identifiers for biomass equations

### Updated iPython notebook From_functional_roles_to_gap-filling.ipynb
Includes updated information on obtaining assigned_functions and extract_functions.py

# Version 1.2

### Crucial edit to setup.py file
Adding PyFBA.model package to list.

# Version 1.1

### Updated all the code to work with Python 3.
However, this breaks compatibility with Python 2 because of the "errors" keyword in open.

The main changes include relative imports, a new class in the tests/ package to allow deep assertions,
and using this type of construct with the open command to ignore unicode errors in ModelSeed:

	with open(ssfile, 'r', errors='replace') as sin:

### Added function to obtain Model SEED complexes from a set of roles

* PyFBA/filters/roles_and_complexes.py

### Added gap-fill step to add reactions based on existent EC numbers

* PyFBA/gapfill/ecnumbers.py

### Optimized and fixed bugs during gap-fill reaction minimization process

* PyFBA/gapfill/reaction_minimization.py

### New Model class objects

Model object contains functionality to make common processes easier to facilitate.

* Generate model from RAST annotations
* Save model to hard disk location
* Load model from hard disk location
* Run FBA
* Run FBA and obtain flux values
* Run FBA and obtain flux values according to SEED subsystems
* Run gap-fill
* Remember which reactions were gap-filled reactions and which media

### New iPython Notebooks

* Find a metabolite.ipynb
* PATRIC to FBA.ipynb
* Gap-fill_a_model.ipynb
* Saving_and_loading_a_model.ipynb

# Version 1.0

## Added a CITATION.md

Please cite us if you use PyFBA

### Added the iPython Notebook directory
Example code showing:

importing an SBML file and running FBA
* iPythonNotebooks/Using_an_SBML_model.ipynb

how to build your model from functional roles and how to gap-fill that model on a media
* iPythonNotebook/From_functional_roles_to_gap-filling.ipynb

### Added minimization by accuracy
Removed PyFBA/gapfill/minimize_additional_reactions.py and created reaction_minimization.py

### Example gap-fill pipeline
* example_code/gapfill_from_reactions_multiple_conditions.py

# Version 0.951

### Removed the author tag
It is superflous, that is what versioning is for.

# Version 0.95

Several changes to files:

### Updated the subsystem functions and changed the name to a generic name. The date is handled by versioning!

* PyFBA/Biochemistry/SEED/Subsystems/SS_functions.txt
* PyFBA/Biochemistry/SEED/Subsystems/SS_functions_Oct_2015.txt

### Changing the version number

* PyFBA/__init__.py

### Adding reaction flux information that can be pulled after the sm has been solved

* PyFBA/fba/__init__.py
* PyFBA/fba/fluxes.py

### External reactions

Fixed an issue where we were over-incorporating reactions based on things in the media

* PyFBA/fba/bounds.py
* PyFBA/parse/model_seed.py

### Adding verboseness

* PyFBA/fba/run_fba.py
* PyFBA/gapfill/roles.py
* PyFBA/parse/read_media.py

### Reduced complexity

We only test the right half of the reactions if the left half do not grow, and once we have <10 reactions
to search through we just iterate and knock out each reaction sequentially. It is faster than the shuffle 
approach.

* PyFBA/gapfill/minimize_additional_reactions.py

### Changed the way we read roles

SEED has a notion of multifunctional roles, and we added splitting those functions into roles

* PyFBA/gapfill/subsystem.py

### Gap generation code

Testing each of the individual reactions in a model

* PyFBA/gapgeneration/test_reactions.py
* example_code/test_individual_reactions.py

### Shifted the order of gapfilling

This order makes more logical sense!

* example_code/gapfill_from_reactions.py

### Updated the tests

With all these changes, the tests were not right

* PyFBA/tests/reaction_list.txt
* PyFBA/tests/test_fba.py
* PyFBA/tests/test_suggestions.py


# Version 0.9
Refactored separating roles to functions. SEED has a concept of [multifunctional roles](http://www.nmpdr.org/FIG/Html/SEED_functions.html) and this separates out our roles before we search for them. 

# Version 0.8

# Version 0.7


# Version 0.6
* Removed installation dependencies from setup.py because they break installation! You need to install the dependencies manually
* Refactored the code to remove the os.environ dependencies

# Version 0.5
* Initial release
